# Repository: FCC-JS

This repository contains solutions (i.e. completed projects) for the course *"JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures"* as instructed by FreeCodeCamp, and was pushed to GitHub to provide a useful resource for fellow programmers who are also completing the course.

There are numerous ways to solve the problems (and after completing the 280+ exercises contained within the course, I'm sure you've managed to come up with your own solutions), so I'm not suggesting that these solutions are optimal. However, I believe that observing how fellow programmers approach the same problems is a fantastic learning exercise, and allows us to expand our horizons and become more proficient.

Although it may be tempting to copy and paste the solution to a project you're struggling with, I'd strongly advise against doing this. It would be more beneficial to analyse the solution, learn how and why it works, and then apply it to your own solution.

Exception handling and sanitisation/validation of user input (and associated data types) is absent and wasn't included in the project specifications. As a result, the solutions aren't production ready. However, FreeCodeCamp ensures that the unit tests provide valid input, so implementing such features would have added unnecessary complexity and cruft to the code.

Finally, if you find this repository helpful, please be sure to click the star button, which will encourage me to maintain this repository (or create other related repositories).

For reference, the course projects are as follows:

* **Palindrome Checker**

  Determines if a case-insensitive string is a palindrome (i.e. identical when read forwards and backwards). Non-alphanumeric characters are stripped before processing.

* **Roman Numeral Converter**

  Converts a base-ten integer into a string of Roman numerals.

* **Caesars Cipher**

  Decodes an uppercase string that was encoded with the ROT13 cipher.

* **Telephone Number Validator**

  Determines if a string is formatted as a valid U.S phone number.

* **Cash Register**

  Calculates the amount and denominations of change required for a cash transaction, and determines whether a particular cash register can accommodate it.
